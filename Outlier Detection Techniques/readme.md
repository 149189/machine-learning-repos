# Outlier Detection Techniques

## But before that let's know about outliers

An outlier is a data point that significantly deviates from the rest of the data. It can be either much higher or much lower than the other data points, and its presence can have a significant impact on the results of machine learning algorithms. They can be caused by measurement or execution errors. The analysis of outlier data is referred to as outlier analysis or outlier mining.

## Importance of outlier detection in machine learning

Outlier detection is important in machine learning for several reasons:
1.	Biased models: Outliers can bias a machine learning model towards the outlier values, leading to poor performance on the rest of the data. This can be particularly problematic for algorithms that are sensitive to outliers, such as linear regression.
2.	Reduced accuracy: Outliers can introduce noise into the data, making it difficult for a machine learning model to learn the true underlying patterns. This can lead to reduced accuracy and performance.
3.	Increased variance: Outliers can increase the variance of a machine learning model, making it more sensitive to small changes in the data. This can make it difficult to train a stable and reliable model.
4.	Reduced interpretability: Outliers can make it difficult to understand what a machine learning model has learned from the data. This can make it difficult to trust the modelâ€™s predictions and can hamper efforts to improve its performance.
