This project aims to predict the electrical energy produced by a 3-kilowatt commercial micro gas turbine based on an input control signal over time.
The dataset includes eight time series experiments that record the gas turbine's behavior under varying input control voltages and the resulting electrical power output.
Each time series represents different experimental conditions and variations in the input control voltage.
Two regression models have been developed to predict the electrical power output from the gas turbine: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor Model.
 The evaluation metrics used include Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which provides insight into the model's accuracy and prediction error.
