# COVID-19 Detection Using X-Ray Images and Deep Learning

## Introduction
This project involves building a deep learning model to detect COVID-19 from X-ray images. The primary goal is to develop a reliable tool that can assist in the rapid screening of COVID-19 cases.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes X-ray images of lungs with and without COVID-19 infection. The dataset can be obtained from various public sources, such as:
 # CLONING THE DATASET FROM THE GITHUB REPOSITORY
!git clone https://github.com/RishitToteja/Chext-X-ray-Images-Data-Set.git

Ensure the dataset is organized into appropriate directories, such as `train`, `validation`, and `test`, each containing subdirectories for positive and negative cases.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the following command:
