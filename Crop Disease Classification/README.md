A crop disease classification model enables early and accurate detection of diseases in crops using images, allowing farmers to take timely actions to treat affected plants. This improves crop yield, reduces the need for manual inspection, and supports precision agriculture by facilitating targeted treatments.

The dataset consists of images of plants, stored in the train_images folder, and a json file containing labels for the images.

The images have been labeled into 5 different classes - "Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)", "Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)", "Cassava Green Mottle (CGM)", "Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)", and "Healthy". The dataset also includes a .csv file that maps the image names to their corresponding labels.
