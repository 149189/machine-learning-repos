# Predictive Traffic Analysis


# Dataset Information

Investors are considering making an investment in a new form of transportation - JetRail. JetRail uses Jet propulsion technology to run rails and move people at a high speed! While JetRail has mastered the technology and they hold the patent for their product, the investment would only make sense, if they can get more than 1 Million monthly users with in next 18 months.
 
You need to help Unicorn ventures with the decision. They usually invest in B2C start-ups less than 4 years old looking for pre-series A funding. In order to help Unicorn Ventures in their decision, you need to forecast the traffic on JetRail for the next 7 months.

 # Description
 This project involves using machine learning techniques to predict traffic patterns. This project applies time series analysis methods to historical traffic data to forecast future traffic conditions. The objective is to provide accurate traffic predictions, which can be beneficial for urban planning, traffic management, and reducing congestion. The project includes data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation to ensure reliable and robust forecasting results.

# Use Cases 
1. Optimize traffic signals.
2. Reroute vehicles.
3. Adjust public transport schedules.
4. Enhance public transport reliability.
5. Plan emergency service routes.
6. Reduce emergency response times.
7. Optimize delivery routes.
8. Avoid logistics delays.
9. Manage traffic for events.
10. Prevent traffic jams.
11. Suggest optimal travel times.
12. Recommend best routes for commuters.
