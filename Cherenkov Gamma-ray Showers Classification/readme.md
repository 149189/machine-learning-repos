The main task is to classify each detected shower image as either:

-Gamma-ray shower: Signal event caused by high-energy gamma rays.

-Hadronic shower: Background event caused by cosmic rays or other particles.

Models Used:
Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost.

By Feature Engineering used Polynomial Features, generated new features by applying polynomial transformations to the original features to capture non-linear relationships.

Dataset: Imported from UCI through Python.
