# Movie recommendation system using Machine learning algorithms

## Recommendation systems:
A recommendation system typically uses machine learning algorithms to study, analyse and understand the consumer behaviour.\
On a large scale, recommender systems form a very big use case from recommending movies, music to recommending clothes to the users based on their previous purchases.\
Recommender systems are basically divided into 3 types:
###  1. Content based Filtering systems:

Movie recommendation which I have creted uses content based recommedation system, i.e it typically recommends 5 movies to the users based on their previously watched movies.

The machine learning algorithm which I have used is the cosine similarity algorithm which is used to find the similairity of the given movie with all the other movies in the dataset and finally recommend the top 5 movies with the highes similarity score.

### 2. Collabrative based filtering systems:

Collabrative filtering systems recommends items to the users based on the choices and preferences of other similar users.

This filtering uses the previous historical data of users and creates a model incorporating the user data as well.

### 3. Hybrid filtering system:
Hybrid system is combination of content based filtering and collabrative based filtering.\
Hybrid recommendation system might use content-based filtering to recommend items that are similar to the ones the user has interacted with before, and collaborative filtering to recommend items that other similar users have liked or interacted with.
