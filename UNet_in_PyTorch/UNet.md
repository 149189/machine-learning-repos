<h2>Introduction</h2>
UNet is a convolutional neural network architecture designed specifically for biomedical image segmentation. In this project, we apply UNet to the Carvana image segmentation dataset to predict the pixel-wise segmentation of car images.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The Carvana image segmentation dataset(taken from kaggle) consists of high-resolution car images with corresponding masks indicating the car's location in each image. The dataset is ideal for training and evaluating segmentation models.

<h2>Model Architecture</h2>
The UNet architecture is known for its U-shaped design, featuring an encoder (contracting path) and a decoder (expanding path). This allows the model to capture context and spatial information effectively, making it suitable for image segmentation tasks.

<h2>Performance Metrics</h2>
To evaluate the model's performance, we use two metrics:

<ul>
  <li>Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted pixels.</li>
  <li>Dice Score: A measure of overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth, defined as:
    
  DiceÂ Score = ![image](https://github.com/tanyasheru23/practice/assets/115335731/b5d2f539-fe66-4fbd-a20b-74edd7930e08)
   where `X` is the set of pixels in the predicted mask, and `Y` is the set of pixels in the ground truth mask. The Dice Score ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no overlap and 1 indicates perfect overlap.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
The model achieves impressive results on the Carvana image segmentation dataset:

<ul>
  <li>Accuracy: 99.635%</li>
  <li>Dice Score: 0.991</li>
</ul>

Here are some of the results:
